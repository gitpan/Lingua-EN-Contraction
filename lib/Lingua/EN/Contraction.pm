=head1 NAME

Lingua::EN::Contraction - Add apostrophes all over the place... 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Lingua::EN::Contraction qw(contraction);

	$sentance = "No, I am not going to explain it. If you cannot figure it out, you did not want to know anyway...  :-)";
	 
	print contraction($sentance) ;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

A very simple, humble little module that adds apostrophes to your sentances for you.  There aren't any options, so if you 
don't like the way it contracts things then you'll have to change the code a bit.  It'll preserve capitalization, so if 
you feed it things like "DO NOT PANIC", you'll get "DON'T PANIC" out the other end.
